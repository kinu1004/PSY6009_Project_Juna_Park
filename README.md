# PSY6009_Project_Juna_Park

This repository is created to share the data source and analysis I ran for
my psychology master degree project at University of Sheffield.

My project is secondary research utilizing two datasets, one from Alsuhibani et al. (2021) and another from McBride et al. (2020). These studies can be found in the folder named 'References/Dataset sources' in the repository.

Accessing Data,
The original datasets are in .sav. (you can find them in 'Origianl' folder inside 'Dataset' folder in this repository.

no single variables are touched. It is as original as I directly received from an author who took part in both studies mentioned above, Professor Richard P. Bentall from University of Sheffiel who is my project supervisor.

Alsuhibani's data does not have any password. McBride's data (Strong Beliefs Replicated 2019) password is 'Shevlin'.


If you want to only look at the variables I chose to use for my study, please access to the 'Cleaned dataset' folder inside 'Dataset' folder. They are in .xlsx format. in the second tab, you will be able to see the codebook for each variables.

You are welcome to play with the data. Thank you.
